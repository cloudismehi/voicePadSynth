# Things to do

### UI
(!) need to add UI adaptability to different voices

### events system
- the basics of the events system is basically written and implemented, i need to determine a way to keep multiple events from targeting the same voice at the same time - as of right now the behavior is undetermined when it comes to this. 
- simplify note changes - it takes too many clicks no one could ever use this live. 

### the voices
- i want to find a way to get multiple voices to react to the same functions - like have the voices linked in some way so that the user can layer sounds. the only way i can think to do this is to have the same syntax functions for all the voice functions. 
- i need more voice engines but that's last on the priority list. 

### the envelopes
- the only envelope determined now is linear, this shouldn't be the only option so i must code another one. i need to implement volume envelopes 

### implement more synth things 
- (!) more oscillator types, filters, lfos, so on and so forth

### need to find a way to save events 
- there's a function that saves events (shortcut s), but there is no way to load them in. i also have to figure out a way to input the name of the file to save. 

### live mode? 
- (!) a simplified version of the ui where one could move the voices with a lot more ease but less control

### troubleshooting
- saving events doesn't work for either saving the first event or saving manually from main
- need to go back to storing addresses not values
