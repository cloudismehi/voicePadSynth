# Things to do

## UI

- (!) **need to add UI adaptability to different voices**
- support for more events that aren't frequency or amplitude - possibly through a sub-menu or something like that

## events system

- determine a way to keep multiple events from targeting the same voice at the same time - as of right now the behavior is undetermined when it comes to this.

## the voices

- i want to find a way to get multiple voices to react to the same functions - like have the voices linked in some way so that the user can layer sounds. the only way i can think to do this is to have the same syntax functions for all the voice functions.
- i need more voice engines but that's last on the priority list.

## the envelopes

- the only envelope determined now is linear, this shouldn't be the only option so i must code another one. i need to implement volume envelopes

## implement more synth things

- more oscillator types, filters, lfos, so on and so forth

## global tempo and clock

- i want to implement a global click that we could sync our event triggering with.

## project layout

i want events to be triggered through some sort of timing system, with a piano roll window to program the events to be played. at some point we could have a "live mode" that does what the synth does now but what i want is for everything to work on some sort of timing system instead.
